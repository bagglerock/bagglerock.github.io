# Welcome to my portfolio!

This is my portfolio that will be updated as time goes.  It contains descriptions and links to pages or apps that I have written as well as logos that I have done in the past as well.  It is written using HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Javascript.  It also uses pictures that I have taken from sunny California, notably Shark's Fin Cove.  

The link for this page is:

The nice parallax effect was written by the person in the following link.  It works great, and also can be seen in newer Ipads and Iphones.
